# DeepfakeDetection
The project aims to detect deepfake videos using deep learning techniques like ResNet and LSTM. It uses a Res-Net Convolution Neural Network to extract frame level features which are then used to train a Long short Term Memory (LTSM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to clasify whether the video is an orginal or deepfake.
